## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Architecture
```javascript
// File upload configuration
const VERIFICATION_DOCS_DIR = path.join(UPLOADS_DIR, 'verification-docs');
const verificationUpload = multer({
  storage: verificationStorage,
  fileFilter: fileFilter,
  limits: { fileSize: 15 * 1024 * 1024 } // 15MB limit
});

// User verification status tracking
const user = {
  hostVerificationStatus: 'not_started',
  verificationDocuments: [],
  verificationSubmittedAt: null,
  verificationReviewedAt: null,
  verificationReviewNotes: '',
  verificationReviewer: null
};
```

### Frontend Component Structure
```javascript
// Multi-step verification process
const steps = [
  'Basic Information',
  'Document Upload', 
  'Review & Submit'
];

// Document upload with validation
const documentTypes = [
  { id: 'government_id', label: 'Government ID', required: true },
  { id: 'proof_of_address', label: 'Proof of Address', required: true },
  { id: 'business_license', label: 'Business License', required: false },
  { id: 'additional_docs', label: 'Additional Documents', required: false }
];
```

### Admin Review Interface
```javascript
// Admin verification review
const reviewOptions = [
  { value: 'approved', label: 'Approve', color: 'success' },
  { value: 'rejected', label: 'Reject', color: 'error' },
  { value: 'request_more_info', label: 'Request More Info', color: 'warning' }
];
```
